        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a traditional dish in my family. Anyone can make it really. It is composed of traditional Mexican ingredients layered over the top of one another in a lasagna-like fashion (hence the name) but has little similarity to lasagna, so lasagna haters have no fear!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds of ground beef</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</li>
            <li>12 (8 inch) flour tortillas, or more if needed</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can refried beans</li>
            <li>3 cups shredded Colby-Jack cheese</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) jar taco sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Colby-Jack cheese</li>
        </ul>
